=head1 NAME

GTB::File - common file-related operations

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use GTB::File qw(Open first_is_older);
    my $infile  = '/path/to/infile.gz';
    my $outfile = '/path/to/outfile.gz';
    if (first_is_older($outfile, $infile)) {
        my $fh_in  = Open($infile);
        my $fh_out = Open($outfile, 'w');
        while (<$fh_in>) {
            print $fh_out $_;
        }
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a library of exportable functions.

=head1 EXPORTABLE FUNCTIONS

=head2 Open($filename [,'w'])

Returns a file handle to the given file, or dies if file can't be opened.
If the filename ends with .gz, it is assumed to be a gzipped file.  if the
filename ends with .bz2, it is assumed to be a bzip2 compressed file.

If the optional 'w' mode is specified, the file is created/overwritten, and an
output filehandle is returned.  This allows gzipped files to be created
directly, rather than writing them uncompressed first. Append 'a' mode also
works for uncompressed and gzipped files.

  my $fh = Open("/path/to/file.gz");
  while (<$fh>) {
      # do stuff
  }

  my $ofh = Open("/path/to/output.bz2", "w");
  print $ofh "Something long\n";
  close $ofh or die "Error closing file, $!";

As of version 0.11, Open() handles one-way pipe commands as well as ordinary
files and STDIN/STDOUT (the latter two represented by '-').

As of version 0.12, Open() will use the program specified in
$GTB::File::GzipIn to decompress and $GTB::File::GzipOut to compress files
with extensions .gz, .Z, .zip.  $GTB::File::Gzip sets the default for both
compression and decompression.

As of version 0.23, there is now a helper method to switch the output
compression method for gzip files to use bgzip, if it is available.  Before
opening the file, call

    GTB::File::use_bgzip([optional path to bgzip]).

As a bit of syntactic sugar, one can also specify this in the import
statement:

    use GTB::File qw(:use_bgzip Open);

=head2 first_is_older

Returns true when the first file is at least one second older than any of the
others.  Frequently used when updating files (a la make), but be careful in
cases where files are changed rapidly or filesystem timestamps are
unreliable.  The value returned is the index number of the first file that is
newer, starting with the value 1.

  if (first_is_older("my.out", "m1.in", "m2.in")) {
      # recreate my.out from m1.in and m2.in
  }

Also returns true (-1) when the first file doesn't exist at all, because it
clearly needs to be recreated in this case.

This method was added in version 0.21.

=head2 wait_for_file

Checks once per second to see if file exists (and is not empty). User can
specify the number of seconds to wait for the file (default is 60 seconds).          Dies if non-empty file is not found.
usage: wait_for_file($file_name, $num_seconds_to_wait)

This method was added in version .22.
